Implemented an unsupervised Deep Learning algorithm called Self Organizing Maps using the MiniSom Library for Fraud Detection</br>

The White grids represents the customers who have a higher probability of cheating the system. The red and green markers denotes whetherthe application of the customer have been approved or not.</br>
We are more interested in customers who are in the White Grids with Green markers because there are the people who have higher probability of comming fraud yet their application was approved.</br>

The intensity of the grids are measured by the Mean InterDistance(MID) between the winning node and the neighbours of the node as defined by the sigma parameter(radius)</br>
