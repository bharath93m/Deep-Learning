## L layer neural network for Image Classification

Created a 4 layer neural network with RELU activation for the hidden layers and Sigmoid activation for the output layer to accurately classify pictures of cats with 80% accuracy. Hope to improve the model by tuning the hyperparameters and by using regularization.
